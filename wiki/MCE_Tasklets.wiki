= MCE Tasklets =

The next upcoming release 1.200 will incorporate support for tasklets. Workers can be configured based on tasking.

To set it up is straight forward. A new option "tasklets" takes an array of tasks. Each set allows for 5 options: max_workers, use_threads, user_begin, user_func, and user_end. Forking and threading can be mixed between sets.

use threads;
use threads::shared;

use MCE;

my $mce = MCE->new(
   input_data => \@ip_list,
   chunk_size => 500,
   tasklets => [{
      max_workers => 8,
      use_threads => 0,
      user_func   => \&pinger
   },{
      max_workers => 48,
      use_threads => 1,
      user_func   => \&poller
   },{
      max_workers => 8,
      use_threads => 1,
      user_func   => \&db
   }]
);

$mce->run();
