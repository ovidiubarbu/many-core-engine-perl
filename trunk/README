MCE version 1.004
=================

Many-core Engine (MCE) for Perl helps enable a new level of performance by
maximizing all available cores. One immediate benefit is that MCE does not
fork a new worker process per each element in an array. Instead, MCE follows
a bank queuing model. Imagine the line being the data and bank-tellers the
parallel workers. MCE enhances that model by adding the ability to chunk
the next n elements from the input stream to the next available worker.
