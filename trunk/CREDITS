All the people reporting problems and fixes or additions. More specifically in
alphabetical order:

David Cantrell (DrHyde on perlmonks.org)
  For reporting on MCE hanging with cpan -t MCE under his environment. Also,
  thank you for providing me a guest account. I was able to reproduce the
  issue. Added writeable check and croak if tmp dir is not writeable.
  One cannot assume that /dev/shm is writeable by everyone. :)

Joseph Ogulin
  For providing me the perl-MCE.spec file.
