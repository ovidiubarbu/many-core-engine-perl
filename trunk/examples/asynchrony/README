## Parallel Concurrency, Asynchrony, and Shared Data (threads or processes).
##
## This folder came about from wanting to show-case parallelism for various
## concurrency modules with MCE. I search the web for echo servers and came
## across a site by Frew Schmidt.
##
## https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/concurrency-and-async-in-perl/
##
## That inspired me to give AnyEvent, IO::Async::Loop, Mojo::IOLoop, and POE
## a try. The examples were updated so to have consistent output between
## them; e.g. both dnslookup_ae.pl and dnslookup_ioa.pl acquire IPv4 and
## IPv6 addresses.
##
## One may add (use threads) above MCE::Flow if threads is desired on any
## Unix-based OS. EV does not work with ithreads. Thus, dnslookup_ae.pl
## and echo_server_mojo.pl cannot run with threads.
