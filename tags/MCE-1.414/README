This document describes MCE version 1.413

 Many-core Engine (MCE) for Perl helps enable a new level of performance by
 maximizing all available cores. MCE spawns a pool of workers and therefore
 does not fork a new process per each element of data. Instead, MCE follows
 a bank queuing model. Imagine the line being the data and bank-tellers the
 parallel workers. MCE enhances that model by adding the ability to chunk
 the next n elements from the input stream to the next available worker.

 Both chunking and input are optional in MCE. One can simply use MCE to have
 many workers run in parallel.

 MCE uses domain sockets for IPC versus pipes. In fact, only 4 socket pairs
 are created for IPC no matter the number of workers. The upcoming 1.5 release
 will do IPC using just 3 socket pairs. One day, a physical box will have 400
 or more cores. MCE can spawn 960 workers (forking) for ulimit reporting 1024
 allowed for max user processes. Other parallel implementations using pipes
 cannot do this (only about half of ulimit -u).

Use Cases for MCE.

 1. Both forking and threading are supported. Workers are children by default
    (spawned via fork). Including threads in your script will have workers
    spawned as threads automatically unless use_threads => 0 is specified.

 2. MCE can be used to process a single "large" file or process many "small"
    files in parallel. Performance against a single file is as fast as MMAP
    IO when specifying use_slurpio => 1.

 3. MCE iterates over input data in chunks. Workers can be spawned prior to
    creating or obtaining data. MCE is a chunking engine. It does not divide
    the input equally by the number of workers. Instead, it chunks from start
    till end.

       input_data => '/path/to/file',    ## Scalar is treated as a file
       input_data => \$scalar,           ## Treated like a memory-based file
       input_data => \@array,            ## A reference to an array
       input_data => \*FileHandle,       ## Process a FH in parallel

    Think of input data as the highway. Now think of the automobile as being
    MCE. Data can be larger than physical memory on the box. The chunking
    nature makes this possible.

 4. If all you need is a numeric iterator, MCE can iterate over a sequence
    of numbers mathematically. This too can be chunked by specifying chunk
    size.

       sequence => { begin => 1, end => 100, step => 2 },
       chunk_size => 20,      ## Worker receives the next 20 sequences

    Look at the examples included with MCE. The foreach.pl example is very
    communication intensive whereas forchunk.pl requires much less overhead.

       foreach.pl, forchunk.pl, and forseq.pl

 5. For another example, a worker receives up to 600 host names or IPs per
    chunk. The worker uses SNMP and an AnyEvent library. Imagine having
    millions of hosts to process. One simply cannot create millions of
    connections all at once. Chunking makes this trivial to do.

Take MCE for a spin.

 The upcoming 1.5 release will be even more fun with less code.

INSTALLATION

 To install this module type the following:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

DEPENDENCIES

 This module requires Perl 5.8.0 or later.

    By default MCE does forking (spawns child processes).
    MCE also supports threads via 2 threading libraries.

    The use of threads in MCE requires that you include threads support
    prior to loading MCE.

       use threads;                  use forks;
       use threads::shared;   (or)   use forks::shared;

       use MCE;                      use MCE;

 This module requires these other modules and libraries:

    Fcntl
    Socket
    Storable 2.04 or later
    File::Path
    Test::More 0.45 or later (for testing)
