David Cantrell (DrHyde on perlmonks.org)
  For reporting on MCE hanging with cpan -t MCE under his environment.
  Thank you for providing a test account to allow me to reproduce the issue.
  One cannot assume that /dev/shm is writeable by everyone. :)
  Added writeable check and croak if tmp dir is not writeable.

  For providing me the perl-MCE.spec file.
