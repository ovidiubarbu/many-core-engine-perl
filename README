This document describes MCE version 1.410

Many-core Engine (MCE) for Perl helps enable a new level of performance by
maximizing all available cores. MCE spawns a pool of workers and therefore
does not fork a new process per each element of data. Instead, MCE follows
a bank queuing model. Imagine the line being the data and bank-tellers the
parallel workers. MCE enhances that model by adding the ability to chunk
the next n elements from the input stream to the next available worker.

Both chunking and input are optional in MCE. One can simply use MCE to have
many workers run in parallel.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires Perl 5.8.0 or later.

   By default MCE does forking (spawns child processes).
   MCE also supports threads via 2 threading libraries.

   The use of threads in MCE requires that you include threads support
   prior to loading MCE.

      use threads;                  use forks;
      use threads::shared;   (or)   use forks::shared;

      use MCE;                      use MCE;

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

   Fcntl
