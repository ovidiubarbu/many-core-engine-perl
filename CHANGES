Revision history for MCE

1.408 Tue Mar 19 22:00:00 EST 2013
    * Minor tweaks here and there to further increase reliability.
    * Updated the barrier synchronization logic to not stall. Updated the
      perl docs on mixing "sync" with "do" or "sendto" methods.
    * Added new "status" method for the manager process.
    * Added new arguments for MCE::Signal: -no_kill9, -no_sigmsg

1.407 Thu Mar 14 21:00:00 EST 2013
    * This marks a tremendous effort in achieving parity across the board
      from Cygwin to Windows and obviously UNIX. MCE now works beautifully
      under the Cygwin environment including Perl for Windows.
    * Up'ed the maximum workers allowed for both Cygwin and Windows to
      56 (forking) and 80 (threading).
    * Barrier synchronization requires an extra semaphore file, therefore
      the maximum workers allowed under the UNIX environment for threading
      decreased. It shouldn't be a problem as there are many threads already.
    * Addressed an issue with barrier synchronization under Cygwin.
    * Addressed an issue with the die handler for the main worker method
      when threading.
    * Thank you for hanging in there. It took quite some time to get there.
      This is the most stable release thus far for MCE across the board.

1.406 Tue Mar 12 19:00:00 EST 2013
    * Added support for barrier synchronization (via new sync method).
      Added barrier_sync.pl example.
    * Addressed rounding errors with the sequence generator.
      The sequence option now follows a bank-teller queuing model when
      generating numbers. This applies to task 0 only. Other tasks can
      still specify sequence where numbers will be distributed equally
      among workers like before.
    * Optimized the _worker_request_chunk private method.
    * A take 2 on the matrix multiplication examples. This is better
      organized with updated README file to include the script running
      time in the results.

1.405 Mon Mar 04 19:00:00 EST 2013
    * Added strassen_pdl_t.pl in the event folks cannot make use of /dev/shm
      used by the strassen_pdl_s.pl example.
    * Optimized the send method -- workers process immediately after receving
      data. Updated run times in README for the strassen examples.
    * MCE no longer calls setpgrp by default as of MCE 1.405. There is only
      one reason to call setpgrp, but many reasons not to. The sole reason
      was for MCE to run correctly with Daemon::Control. If needed, one can
      pass the option to MCE::Signal qw(-setpgrp).
    * Return void in the shutdown method (previously was returning $self).
    * Tidy code inside sequence generator.

1.404 Sun Feb 24 13:00:00 EST 2013
    * Added sess_dir method
    * Completed work with matmult/* examples
      Added matmult_pdl_q.pl, removed strassen_pdl_h.pl
      Added strassen_pdl_o/p/q/r/s.pl 
      Added benchmark results from a 32-way box at the end of the readme
    * Removed lines setting max limit for files/procs

1.403 Sun Feb 17 15:00:00 EST 2013
    * Wrap sub PDL::CLONE_SKIP into a no warnings 'redefine' block
      MCE now works with PDL::Parallel::threads without any warnings
    * Added missing examples/matmult/matmult_pdl_n.pl to MANIFEST
    * Refactored strassen examples, memory consumption reduced by > than 50%
    * Added matmult_pdl_o.pl -- uses PDL::Parallel::threads to share matrices
    * Added matmult_pdl_p.pl -- matrix b is read from shared memory, not mmap
    * Added strassen_pdl_n.pl -- additional improvements to memory reduction
    * Added strassen_pdl_h.pl -- shown running with 4 workers (half and half)
    * Re-ran matrix multiplication examples and updated results in README file
    * Added -no_setpgrp option to MCE::Signal.pm
      Ctrl-C does not respond when running /usr/bin/time mce_script.pl
    * Added undef $buffer in a couple of places within MCE.pm
    * Added David Mertens and Adam SjÃ¸gren to CREDITS
    * The send method now checks if sending > total workers after spawning
      not before

1.402 Thr Feb 14 07:30:00 EST 2013
    * Updated matrix multiplication examples including README
    * Added examples/matmult/matmult_pdl_n.pl

1.401 Tue Feb 12 19:00:00 EST 2013
    * Added sub PDL::CLONE_SKIP { 1 } to MCE.pm. Running PDL + MCE threads no
      longer crashes during exiting.
    * Updated matrix multiplication examples. All examples now work under the
      windows environment no matter if threading or forking. Unix is stable as
      well if wanting to use PDL + MCE and use_threads => 1 or 0.
    * Added benchmark results for 2048x2048, 4096x4096, and 8192x8192 to the
      README file under examples/matmult/
    * Updated documentation

1.400 Mon Feb 11 07:00:00 EST 2013
    * Slight optimization in the _do_callback method

    * Added new send method for sending data to workers after spawning and
      prior to running
    * The sequence option can now take an ARRAY reference
    * Updated documentation on new features
    * Added matrix multiplication examples

1.306 Sat Jan 05 18:00:00 EST 2013
    * Added if statement around setpgrp(0,0). That function is not supported
      under Windows.
    * Updated logic for removing any remaining MCE session directories inside
      MCE::Signal.

1.305 Sat Jan 05 16:00:00 EST 2013
    * Added check for $^S to the DIE handler inside the _worker_main method
    * Added setpgrp(0,0) to MCE::Signal's BEGIN block
    * MCE::Signal points to a _mce_sess_dir hash in the event of a signal,
      will remove the sess_dir(s) as well. This is needed when tmp_dir is
      specified during instantiation and pointing to another location than
      MCE::Signal::tmp_dir.

1.304 Wed Jan 02 22:00:00 EST 2013
    * Added Oliver Gorwits to CREDITS for identifying 2 issues
