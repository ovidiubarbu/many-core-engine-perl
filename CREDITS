Berger, Joel
  The inspiration for the sixth model (MCE::Step) came from reading a blog
  "Writing Non-Blocking Applications with Mojolicious: Part 3" by Joel at
  http://blogs.perl.org/users/joel_berger/2014/01/
         writing-non-blocking-applications-with-mojolicious-part-3.html

Bouras, George
  For reporting sockets failing under the Windows enviroment due to a
  period of inactivity. An example is when workers execute an external
  command taking beyond 4 minutes to complete. On returning, the sockets
  have gone stale with a CPU core going 100% at this point.

Cantrell, David (DrHyde on perlmonks.org)
  For reporting on MCE hanging with cpan -t MCE under his environment. Also,
  thank you for providing me a guest account. I was able to reproduce the
  issue. Added writeable check and croak if tmp dir is not writeable.
  One cannot assume that /dev/shm is writeable by everyone. :)

Collet, Eric
  For the inspiration to the tre-agrep binary.
  * I first learned of tre-agrep from Eric. He emailed me running times for
    a couple scenarios utilizing a single core. Thus increasing the need to
    have a MCE-driven wrapper to run tre-agrep in parallel.
  * The bin/mce_grep script was created to show folks how one may go about
    chunking data between Perl and an external C binary efficiently without
    invoking the shell. The script supports grep, egrep, fgrep, agrep and
    tre-agrep.

Gorwits, Oliver
  For reporting on a couple issues with MCE along with a solution for each.
  * Pointed me in the right direction for improving the logic for the die
    handler. Basically, eval { die 'this should not cause MCE to die' };
  * Changed INIT { ... } to sub import { ... } inside MCE.pm.
  * This has reached 100% (all cases, threads and processes) in MCE 1.600.

Halpenny, Shawn
  For reporting an issue (bug RT#94706) with signal handling in MCE::Signal.
  Also, thank you for tip on getpgrp.

Jacobsen, Dana
  For reporting an issue with get_ncpu on AIX. In addition, suggesting
  various solutions.

Kulow, Stephan
  For making an OpenSUSE package for MCE.
  https://build.opensuse.org/package/show/devel:languages:perl:CPAN-M/perl-MCE

Lu, Henry
  For listening during our walks on numerous occasions while I talked about
  how ridiculously hard to provide support for the Windows environmemnt.
  For encouraging me to hang in there when I wanted to give up.

Mabon, Philip
  For reporting on a couple issues with MCE in particular bug RT#92627.

Mertens, David
  I am thankful for the tip on making PDL + MCE a possibility. Workers were
  crashing during exiting. Adding "sub PDL::CLONE_SKIP { 1 }" inside MCE.pm
  solved this issue entirely. Also, for pointers on how to effectively use PDL
  from his example matmult_pdl_thr.pl utilizing PDL::Parallel::threads::SIMD
  at https://gist.github.com/run4flat/4942132.

Ogulin, Joseph
  For providing the initial perl-MCE.spec file.
  For the cool remarks at work about MCE being really big :)

Riccardi, Demian
  I received a message from Demian asking for mce_map. His message requested
  ( my @a = mce_map { ... } 1..100 ). Five models were introduced in v1.500;
  MCE::Flow, MCE::Grep, MCE::Loop, MCE::Map, and MCE::Stream.

Rowe, Jillian
  For reporting on IO::File handles not working with MCE. Fixed in 1.515.
  For believing in possibilities beyond text-book thinking.

Roy, Sylvia
  For driving on long trips while I worked in the passenger seat further
  developing MCE. Not to forget, locally around town as well. Gosh, a lot
  of MCE was developed on the road not to forget Panera Bread.

Šabata, Petr
  For initial package submission at Red Hat.
  https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1162531

Sasser, Tom
  For reporting on bin/mce_grep failing with Perl 5.8.x.

Schlichting, Florian
  For making a Debian package for MCE: http://pkgs.org/search/libmce-perl.

Shen, Wei
  For the BioUtil CPAN module. BioUtil::Seq::FastaReader inspired me to
  create parallel examples (biofasta folder) in MCE 1.600. We tried to
  make FastaReader even faster.

Sjøgren, Adam
  For reporting on running /usr/bin/time mce_script.pl and pressing Ctrl-C
  failing. The default behavior in MCE::Signal is to call setpgrp. MCE 1.403
  adds a new option to MCE::Signal to not call setpgrp. This also gives the
  developer finer control as to where setpgrp should be called, if ever needed,
  such as in the child process and not the manager process.
  
    use MCE::Signal qw(-no_setpgrp);
    use MCE;

Smith, Marcus
  For reporting a problem with MCE including a sample script demonstrating
  MCE not 100% UTF-8 safe. All this time, totally overlooked the fact that
  the length function deals in logical characters, not physical bytes. :)

Thalhammer, Jeffrey Ryan
  For submitting a feature request on support for lazy arrays.
  * Although a lazy array cannot be used directly for input_data, support for
    iterator objects was added to MCE 1.505; e.g. input_data => $iterator_ref;
    This enabled support for lazy arrays using closures.
  * I am thankful for the small code snippet highlighting a use-case of MCE.
    I would have failed initially without it. Your example was placed under
    the "SYNTAX for INPUT_DATA" section in MCE::Core for others to see on
    how to process output from Path::Iterator::Rule in parallel.
