All the people reporting problems and fixes or additions. More specifically in
alphabetical order by last name:

David Cantrell (DrHyde on perlmonks.org)
  For reporting on MCE hanging with cpan -t MCE under his environment. Also,
  thank you for providing me a guest account. I was able to reproduce the
  issue. Added writeable check and croak if tmp dir is not writeable.
  One cannot assume that /dev/shm is writeable by everyone. :)

Oliver Gorwits
  For reporting on a couple issues with MCE along with a solution for each.
  * Pointed me in the right direction for improving the logic for the die
    handler. Basically, eval { die 'this should not cause MCE to die' };
  * Changed INIT { ... } to sub import { ... } inside MCE.pm.

Joseph Ogulin
  For providing me the perl-MCE.spec file.


Thank you all for your help,

Mario
